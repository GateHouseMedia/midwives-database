# Building a national database of midwives

Code for scraping, cleaning and compiling the [national database of midwives](http://gatehousenews.com/failuretodeliver/explore-the-database/) as part of GateHouse Media's ["Failure to Deliver" series](http://gatehousenews.com/failuretodeliver).

Because there's no centralized way to for mothers to background their midwife providers, we decided to create our own. 

We scraped or requested data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia for licensed certified nurse midwives and/or midwives. In states that don't license non-nurse midwives, we collected lists from state midwife organizations, if available. You can read more about our methodology [here](http://gatehousenews.com/failuretodeliver/methodology/). 

We then cleaned and compiled the data in R. 

## Worth noting

I'm new to coding, so many of these are first or early attempts and may read a little clunky.
